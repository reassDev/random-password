# password generator website
A website to generate random **passwords**.

It is very simple to use, just click the "Generate Password" button and click the copy icon or copy it manually.
Boom you have a secure password.

In the future I will be updating the looks of the customization options, as currently they are just the ugly base HTML ones.

Very easy to set up for yourself, just fork the project and set up github pages, or download the files and run the index.html file.
