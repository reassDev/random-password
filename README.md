# password generator website
A website to generate random **passwords**.

It is very simple to use, just click the "Generate Password" button and click the copy icon or copy it manually.
Boom you have a secure password.

In the future I will be updating the looks of the customization options, as currently they are just the ugly base HTML ones.

Demo of the Website is at: [https://reassignment.github.io/random-password/](url)

Very easy to set up for yourself, just fork the project and set up github pages, or download the files and run the index.html file.
