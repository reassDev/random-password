# password generator website
A website to generate random **passwords**.

It is very simple to use, just click the "Generate Password" button and click the copy icon or copy it manually.
Boom you have a secure password.

In the future I will be adding options to the website, so you can choose if you want uppercase, lowercase, symbols and numbers in your password and the length of the password.

Demo of the Website is at: [https://reassignment.github.io/random-password/](url)

Very easy to set up for yourself, just fork the project and set up github pages, or download the files and run the index.html file.
